[![Clojure CI](https://github.com/baskeboler/html2hiccup/actions/workflows/clojure.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/baskeboler/html2hiccup/actions/workflows/clojure.yml)

convert html snippets to hiccup with ease 

## Installation

Download from https://github.com/html2hiccup/html2hiccup

## Usage

FIXME: explanation

Run the project directly, via `:exec-fn`:

    $ clojure -X:run-x

Run the project, overriding the name to be greeted:

    $ clojure -X:run-x :name '"Someone"'

Run the project directly, via `:main-opts` (`-m html2hiccup.html2hiccup`):

    $ clojure -M:run-m
    Hello, World!

Run the project, overriding the name to be greeted:

    $ clojure -M:run-m Via-Main
    Hello, Via-Main!


Run the project's CI pipeline and build an uberjar (this will fail until you edit the tests to pass):

    $ clojure -T:build ci

This will produce an updated `pom.xml` file with synchronized dependencies inside the `META-INF`
directory inside `target/classes` and the uberjar in `target`. You can update the version (and SCM tag)
information in generated `pom.xml` by updating `build.clj`.

If you don't want the `pom.xml` file in your project, you can remove it. The `ci` task will
still generate a minimal `pom.xml` as part of the `uber` task, unless you remove `version`
from `build.clj`.

Run that uberjar:

    $ java -jar target/html2hiccup-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar

If you remove `version` from `build.clj`, the uberjar will become `target/html2hiccup-standalone.jar`.
